## Technologies Used
- Python3:-  Python is now one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. Besides web and software development, Python is used for data analytics, machine learning, and even design.
- Tkinter for GUI:- We build our address book project with the help pf tkinter module. Tkinter is a standard GUI library for rendering graphics. 
- SQL LITE For DataBase:- SQLite is often used as the on-disk file format for desktop applications such as version control systems, financial analysis tools, media cataloging and editing suites, CAD packages, record keeping programs, and so forth. The traditional File/Open operation calls sqlite3_open() to attach to the database file.
